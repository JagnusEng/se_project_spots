**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

## Project Description

Spots is a responsive web application that adjusts its layout and design elements based on different screen sizes. The project showcases a profile section with editable information, dynamically placed cards, and a well-structured footer. It is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## Future Improvements

- Add animations to card elements.
- Optimize loading speed by compressing images.
- Improve the overall user experience on smaller screens.

## Live Demo

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
