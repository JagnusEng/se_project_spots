# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

This project involves creating a responsive web application called Spots, which is an interactive social media platform where users can add and remove photos, like photos from other users, and update their profiles. The project incorporates adaptive web design principles and ensures the site layout adjusts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using techniques like media queries, Flexbox, and Grid.
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
