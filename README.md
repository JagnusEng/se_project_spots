<<<<<<< HEAD
This project involves creating a responsive web application called Spots, which is an interactive social media platform where users can add and remove photos, like photos from other users, and update their profiles. The project incorporates adaptive web design principles and ensures the site layout adjusts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using techniques like media queries, Flexbox, and Grid.
  
**Technologies and Techniques Used**
  
1. HTML5: Structure of the web pages using semantic tags.
2. CSS3: Styling the application, including custom fonts, layouts, and responsive design techniques.
3. BEM Methodology: File structure and class naming for maintainable CSS.
4. Flexbox and CSS Grid: For responsive layouts, specifically the card grid system.
5. Media Queries: To handle different breakpoints for desktop (1440px), tablet, and mobile (320px).
6. GitHub Pages: Deployed the project for public access.
7. Figma: Used to reference design mockups for different device screen sizes.
8. Font Management: Applied Google Fonts (Poppins) with @font-face. 


**Functionality**  
1. Responsive Layout:
    -Desktop (1440px): A three-column card layout with a maximum content width of 1280px.
    -Tablet: A two-column card layout.
  -Mobile (320px): A single-column card layout.
2. Profile Editing: Users can update profile information and preview the changes dynamically.
3. Overflow Handling: Text overflow is managed with ellipses for both single-line and multi-line content.
4. Adaptive Design: Uses media queries to adjust font sizes, margins, and paddings for different screen sizes.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
