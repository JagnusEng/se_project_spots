**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

## Project Description

Spots is a responsive web application that adjusts its layout and design elements based on different screen sizes. The project showcases a profile section with editable information, dynamically placed cards, and a well-structured footer. It is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## Future Improvements

- Add animations to card elements.
- Optimize loading speed by compressing images.
- Improve the overall user experience on smaller screens.

### Image

- I exported an image from Figma for this project. You can view the process [here](https://www.figma.com/).
- After exporting, I optimized the images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to reduce file sizes, ensuring faster load times for the project.
- Example image: `Cards.png`, which is used in the layout.
